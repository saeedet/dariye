## Preview

A simple social media platform where users can choose a character and share posts, upload images, add comments and reply to each other. Also, users can like each post as well as each other's comments and replys. I used Firebase for backend processes which makes life much easier but I faced my first reading and writing limit problem in cloud services which can end up costly in applications like social media if you don't plan and optimise your queries properly. learning about optimized queries on NoSQL databases was priceless in this project.

## How to use

This project is using Firebase and their cloud functions. You need to create a Firebase account and make sure you populate a `.env` file according to the secrets in `firebase.js`
